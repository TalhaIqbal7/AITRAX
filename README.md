FYP: AI-Based Lung Disease Detection System
Project Overview
This project, titled AI-Based Lung Disease Detection System, leverages machine learning and computer vision techniques to detect lung diseases, particularly focusing on pulmonary fibrosis, from medical imaging. The goal of the project is to provide a reliable, accurate, and efficient system for early detection, which can assist medical professionals in diagnosis and treatment planning.

Pulmonary Fibrosis Detection: Uses deep learning algorithms to analyze medical images and predict the presence of pulmonary fibrosis.
High Accuracy: The model is optimized for accuracy, providing reliable predictions.
Explainable AI: Uses techniques to help understand the model's decision-making process, supporting interpretability.
Dataset
The project uses a dataset of lung images (e.g., CT scans or X-rays). Each image is labeled according to the presence or absence of lung diseases. Details regarding data sources and preprocessing are available in the report. Ensure all data is preprocessed and organized before training.

Note: Some datasets might require registration or permissions to access.

Model Architecture
The system employs a deep learning model, potentially leveraging architectures such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image processing. The model is trained to identify patterns indicative of pulmonary fibrosis and other lung conditions.

Input Layer: Processes the raw images.
Hidden Layers: Multiple convolutional and pooling layers extract features from the images.
Output Layer: Provides a prediction score indicating the likelihood of lung disease.
Further technical details about the model architecture and parameters can be found in the project's final report.
