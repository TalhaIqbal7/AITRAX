AI-Based Lung Disease Detection System (AITRAX)
Project Overview
The AITRAX project aims to assist in the early detection of lung diseases using AI, with a particular focus on pulmonary fibrosis. By analyzing medical images (such as CT scans or X-rays), this AI-based detection system provides a predictive analysis to support healthcare professionals in diagnosing lung conditions.

Features
Pulmonary Fibrosis Detection: Accurately identifies signs of fibrosis and other lung abnormalities from medical images.
Explainable AI: Incorporates interpretable AI techniques, allowing clinicians to understand how the AI reaches its conclusions.
Early Detection: Aims to detect diseases at an earlier stage, which can lead to better outcomes for patients.

Dataset
The system was trained on a collection of lung images, including normal and abnormal scans, to accurately classify the presence of diseases. All images were preprocessed to improve model accuracy.

Image Idea: Sample preprocessed image used for model training and evaluation.

Model Architecture
AITRAX uses a deep learning architecture, likely a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), optimized for medical image analysis. This architecture was selected to handle the complexity of medical image data and to extract relevant features associated with pulmonary diseases.


Results
The AI model has shown promising results in detecting lung disease, achieving high accuracy and reliability. The project's final report includes an analysis of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores, showcasing the effectiveness of AITRAX in diagnosing pulmonary fibrosis.


Future Directions
To further enhance the AITRAX project, the following improvements are planned:

Model Optimization: Experimenting with advanced model architectures and hyperparameter tuning.
Diverse Datasets: Expanding the training dataset to include more diverse patient data.
User Interface: Building a user-friendly interface for easier deployment in healthcare settings.
